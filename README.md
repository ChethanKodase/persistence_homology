# Persistence Homology calculation for point clouds through brute search for loops and simplices of different dimensions in the distance matrix!

An alternate method to calculate persistence homology for the point clouds to keep track of distinct points involved in formation of a specific topological feature

## persistence homology dimension availability
Code for zero dimensional persistence homology calculation is completed.
